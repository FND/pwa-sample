PWA Explorations
================

see [PWA notes](docs/pwa.md) for general observations


Getting Started
---------------

* ensure [Node](http://nodejs.org) is installed
* `npm install` downloads dependencies
* `npm start` launches development mode, serving the application at
  <http://localhost:8000/index.html> and automatically recompiling while
  monitoring code changes
* `npm test` checks code for stylistic consistency
